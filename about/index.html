      <h2>Current Objectives</h2>
      <p>Right now I am working on creating and securing a Samba Fileshare that I can access from outside of my home network. This domain was initially to be used for that, but <br> I have ultimately decided to utilize this domain for other things.</p>

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Not much to be known. I grew up in Washington, went to school here, and work in the Seattle region. I work in a datacenter, mostly hardware maintenance. I am trying to branch out and learn more, which is why i'm challenging myself to develop this website. As of now I do not have an end goal with it; maybe it'll be a sort of capsule to show the world long after i'm gone that I existed, forever archived in the bowels of the internet. Who knows? Maybe in a couple hundred years someone will find this archived page and get to percieve me one last time.</p>
