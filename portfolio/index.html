      <h2>RocketChat on CLI</h2>
      <p>
        This project was a requirement for a final project in a Linux Administration course I took in college. In this project we had four Ubuntu and four Fedora machines and we had to establish a chat server between them. RocketChat is a communications application that typically only runs on a GUI therefore easily establishing communication for the required Ubuntu machine but leaving out the Fedora machines. I had attempted installing a horrible CLI web-browser that somehow had a GUI that looked as though it was made in 1996 and ran like it was made in the 60s; this did not work. I had to problem solve and create a program that would allow the Fedora CLI to connect to the chat server being hosted on one of the Ubuntu machines and be able to send and receive messages in real time. I used JavaScript to do this. I am not a programmer by any means, I had help from external tools in creating the foundations of this code. Anyway, it wound up working pretty smoothly and contained all of the functionality I had hoped it would. It prompted users for a username and password and denied unauthorized entry, it allowed for real time communication between all machines on the network that had the proper files in their directories, and satisfied communication needs with minimal delays. All in all, it isn't much but it shows that when faced with an unavoidable challenge I will persevere through it and solve it to the best of my abilities. <br> <a href="/portfolio/send-message.html">Here is a link to the code.</a>
